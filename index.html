	<p>
		Hello and welcome! My name is Julianne Delia and I am a junior at <a href="american.edu">American University</a> in Washington, DC. I am doubling majoring in Communication Studies and Computer Science. I'm from Springfield, NJ and live with my two parents, three siblings, and pet dog. I have an older sister, older brother, and younger sister. My dog is a shih tzu (and she will be featured in a lot of my pictures!). At AU, I am an Ambassador, which means I give tours and interact with campus visitors. Along with giving tours, I also work in the marketing department of the <a href="https://www.american.edu/careercenter/">AU Career Center.</a>

		This website is designed to showcase my professional resume and a photo gallery of pictures that I took with my Nikon DSL camera. Featured in these pictures are my family members, my dog, and my friends. I started taking pictures in 2016, so bulk of the photos will be from 2016-2018. I will not include every single picture that I've taken (because that would be way too many), but I will include some of the best/my favorites.
		<br>
		<br>
		I hope you enjoy looking through my pictures, and please, feel free to contact me through via the "Contact" page.
